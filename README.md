# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here. //fixme :)

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Use HTML to properly structure the pages. The pages will include a login page (users login or create an account), a main page (players create a game, join a game, or logout), and a game page (users play the game).
- **CSS** - Create style sheets to give the application consistent, accessible styling that is visually pleasing, and ensure that the application looks correct at various sizes.
- **React** - Provide login, joining a game, game display and update, etc.; will be used for routing and page components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - account creation
    - submitting game/player info
    - retrieving game/player info
- **DB/Login** - Store user information credentials securely. Store game templates and game/player information. Register users and authenticate login. Can't create/join a game unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - Completed text box entries will be updated in real time for all players; players will be notified when another player joins or exits, and will be notified when it is their turn.
